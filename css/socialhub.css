	RELEASE NOTES:
	
	Release v1.4.1 bump version
	
	Release v1.4 (Bacchus)

	Tickets Addressed:
	https://jira.cmgdigital.com/browse/JANUS-2165 (Clicking on twitter username opens another user's profile (Livefyre)
	https://jira.cmgdigital.com/browse/JANUS-2359 (iPhone 5, iPad - Content takes longer time to load)
	https://jira.cmgdigital.com/browse/JANUS-2166 (Missing IG Name upon media expansion across the screen)
	https://jira.cmgdigital.com/browse/JANUS-2290 (Tweets with Facebook Link Display issue)
	https://jira.cmgdigital.com/browse/JANUS-2212 (Images for share window)
	https://jira.cmgdigital.com/browse/HELPDESK-42771 (Can't find content marked "featured")
	
	Ticket Resolutions:
	JANUS-2165: SDK Update (2.6.10)
	JANUS-2359: Reworked injection of sharing meta to use internal storage instead of page to avoid script errors; reworked the Load More button displays
	JANUS-2166: SDK Update (2.6.10)
	JANUS-2290: According to Facebook documentation:"
	
	Can I customize how the post is displayed on my web page?
	
	Currently, you cannot customize how Embedded Posts are displayed on your page. The size of the post is fixed to the same dimensions as it's shown on Facebook
	
	." 
	
	So unfortunately the only available resolution lies with Facebook themselves, but I've added a few tweaks to make it at least a bit better with keeping the URLs inside the card. On the whole, however, this is a Facebook limitation
	
	JANUS-2212: Added support for images shared for all card types
	HELPDESK-42771: Same resolution as JANUS-2359 to avoid script errors.
